#Java Basics
##I am new to Java. Here are some personal notes to myself.
.
.
##basic syntax
	1. Java is a strictly object orientated language. It is also a compiled langauge. 
	2. public static void main() serves as a starting point for the program.
	3. always create an instance of the driver class to access methods. 
	4. class A implements interface. class Child extends BaseClass
##generic classes
	1. Makes a class that works for any data type. Class A<T>{};



#Stacks August 26 2019

Stacks are FIFO. Sort of like a plate dispenser. You push items to the top and you pop items from the top. 

	1. push() //adds to the top of the arrayStack. Increases size by 1.
	2. pop() //returns the top value and moves the top down. Size is decreased by 1.
	3. peek() //gets the top value. Does not change the size/top.
	4. isFull(), isEmpty(), size() //self-explanatory.
